# Abon Example - User Profile

In this example, you will see how a special class can be made, extending `AbonDeep`, to provide property combinations as well as other values related to the state. The idea is that a user profile is fetched given an identifier passed to the root component, and that different parts of the state is then used at different levels by different components.
